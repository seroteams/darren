# Pre-go-live — PROGRESS (living log)

**This is the single source of truth for where the pre-go-live track is.** The agent reads it on every
"what next?" and updates it after every action. The [OVERVIEW](OVERVIEW.md) is the fixed playbook; this
file is what changes.

Status words: `not-started` (not broken down) · `planned` · `in-progress` · `awaiting-qa` · `done`.

## Active phase

**→ Phase 007 — Admin: who's registered — `planned` (broken down 2026-07-04; no code written yet)**

Broken into 2 steps + QA. **Finding while breaking it down:** the PG6 endpoint returns companies → users
**only** (run stats were out of PG6 scope), but the PG7 screen wants run counts / last-active / rating
summary — so **Step 01 is a backend enrichment step**, not just a frontend screen as the terse overview
implied. **Open scope choice for Carl:** full return-visit signal (run count + last-active + this-week/last-
week + alpha rating summary) vs a minimal list (company → users + run count + last-active). Steps written to
the full scope; easy to trim at build time.

PG7 steps:
- [ ] **01 — Enrich the registered data** ([01-registered-data.md](007-admin-registered/01-registered-data.md))
  — backend, test-first. Add per-user `runCount` / `lastActiveAt` / `runsThisWeek` / `runsLastWeek` + a
  top-level alpha `summary` (avgStars / ratedCount / lowCount) to `GET /api/v1/admin/registered`. Derivation
  in the service (fake-repo testable, `now` passed in); still guarded, read-only, no `password_hash`.
- [ ] **02 — The "Registered" screen** ([02-registered-screen.md](007-admin-registered/02-registered-screen.md))
  — frontend admin stage at `/admin/registered` (admin page pattern), fetch + render companies → users with
  the signal + summary; own states. Nav item shown only to the superadmin via a new `isSuperadmin` flag on
  `GET /api/v1/auth/me` (a boolean, never the allowlist) — **cosmetic; the backend 403 stays the real wall.**
- [ ] **99 — QA sign-off** ([99-qa-signoff.md](007-admin-registered/99-qa-signoff.md)) — Carl sees every
  company + users + signal; a normal owner: no nav item **and** 403 on the route.

Next: `go` (full scope) or "trim to minimal" → then build Step 01.

**Phase 006 — Superadmin gate — ✅ `done` (signed off + committed 2026-07-04).** Carl approved the security
shape + tests ("approved"). Backend-only, test-first (13 tests): `requireSuperadmin` guard reads the
server-resolved `identity.email` against `SUPERADMIN_EMAILS` (dev side-door can't pass); read-only-by-
construction `superadmin` service + guarded GET `/api/v1/admin/registered` (no `password_hash`); one audit
line per access (refused access not audited). 56/56, typecheck clean. **Carry-forward before the alpha
widens** (still open by design): human-expert review must cover this key · close anon `POST /api/v1/sessions`
· privacy-note disclosure.

Broken into 3 test-first steps + QA. Backend-only, no screen (PG7/PG8 build those). **Verified anchors while
breaking it down:** `RequestIdentity` **already** carries a server-resolved `email` (request-context.ts:16),
so the guard is a thin add, not plumbing; the guards live in `require-auth.ts` (mirror `requireAdmin`) and
the route wrapper in `admin-guard.ts` (mirror `requireAdminRoute`); `organizations`/`users` tables exist in
`schema.ts`; the dev side-door email is `dev@seroteams.com` (not Carl's), so it can't satisfy the allowlist.

PG6 steps:
- [x] **01 — Superadmin guard** ([01-superadmin-guard.md](006-superadmin-gate/01-superadmin-guard.md)) —
  **built test-first 2026-07-04.** `normalizeEmail` + `isSuperadminIdentity` + `requireSuperadmin` in
  `require-auth.ts` (allowlist parsed fresh from `SUPERADMIN_EMAILS`, reads server-resolved `identity.email`
  only); `requireSuperadminRoute` in new `superadmin-guard.ts` (mirrors `admin-guard.ts`, injectable lookup).
  8 tests written first (red) then green: normalize folds case/space + rejects empty, allowlisted passes,
  owner → 403, anonymous → 401, empty allowlist → nobody, **dev side-door → 403**. `npm test` 54/54,
  typecheck clean. No route wired yet (Step 02).
- [x] **02 — Cross-company read** ([02-cross-company-read.md](006-superadmin-gate/02-cross-company-read.md))
  — **built test-first 2026-07-04.** New `services/superadmin/` (repo = SELECT-only reads of
  `organizations`/`users`, **never** selects `password_hash`; service groups users under their company,
  oldest-first, owns the ordering; thin controller). `GET /api/v1/admin/registered` wired via
  `superadminV1 = v1Route(requireSuperadminRoute(h))` — GET-only, funnelled through the Step-01 guard.
  Service tests (fake repo, red→green): grouping/order correct, empty-company and no-companies cases, and
  **no `passwordHash`/`orgId` leak into the view**. `npm test` 55/55, typecheck clean. (Owner→403 /
  dev-side-door→403 proven in the Step-01 guard tests; GET-only = no mutating route registered.)
- [x] **03 — Audit line** ([03-audit-line.md](006-superadmin-gate/03-audit-line.md)) — **built test-first
  2026-07-04.** `superadmin-audit.ts`: pure `superadminAuditEntry` (at/userId/email/method/route, no secret)
  + `appendSuperadminAudit` (one JSONL line to gitignored `content/data/audit/`). Called from the
  `requireSuperadminRoute` funnel **after** the guard passes (sink injectable), so a 403 is never audited as
  success. Tests (red→green): an authorized access audits exactly once with the right entry; a refused access
  audits zero. Confirmed **hermetic** (no audit file written during `npm test`). 56/56, typecheck clean.
- [ ] **99 — QA sign-off** ([99-qa-signoff.md](006-superadmin-gate/99-qa-signoff.md)) — mostly test results
  + the security shape in plain words + the three carry-forward conditions before the alpha widens.

Next: `go` → build Step 01 (the guard, test-first).

**Phase 005 — Person detail — ✅ `done` (signed off + committed 2026-07-04).** Carl walked it ("looks good
commit"). Clicking a Team person opens their page: header summary, their 1:1s newest-first (each reopens
the PG2 read-only briefing), the "Since last time" recap (last meeting's agreed actions + watch-fors), and
"Prep your next 1:1 with <name>" seeding a fresh intake — all fenced to the manager's own runs, no OpenAI
call. Plus a mid-phase UI polish (elevated colour-coded recap, quiet log). Baseline + post green.

Broken into 3 build steps + QA. Clicking a person card (from the PG4 Team page) opens their page — all the
manager's 1:1s with that person, their rating history, and the minimal "since last time" (most-recent
`next_actions` + `watch_for`, already in the payload). Reuses `groupRunsByPerson`, the PG1 row, the PG2
detail, and the PG3 ratings — little new backend.

PG5 steps:
- [x] **01 — The person page** ([01-person-page.md](005-person-detail/01-person-page.md)) — **built
  2026-07-04.** New `PERSON_DETAIL` stage at `/team/:person` (state + router + main plumbing mirroring
  `RUN_DETAIL`); Team cards are now keyboard-operable buttons that open the person page; header summary
  (name · role · N meetings · last · avg) + her runs newest-first (with ★ badge); loading / error /
  not-found ("no 1:1s with this person yet") states. New shared `personKeyOf()` in `group-people.js` so
  the page filters runs on the exact same key the grouping uses (no drift). Rows are display-only — opening
  them is Step 03. No backend change (still `/runs/mine`). Typecheck clean, `npm test` 53/53.
- [x] **02 — "Since last time"** ([02-since-last-time.md](005-person-detail/02-since-last-time.md)) —
  **built 2026-07-04** (Carl chose to build, not park). A block at the top of the person page shows the
  most recent 1:1's agreed next-actions ("What you agreed") + watch-fors ("What to watch for"); hidden
  entirely when both are empty (no scaffolding). The list payload carries no briefing, so it fetches just
  that one run's detail (`getMyRun`) — **no OpenAI call**. Minimal slice of the deferred "remembering".
  Typecheck clean, `npm test` 53/53.
- [x] **03 — Open + prep next** ([03-open-and-prep.md](005-person-detail/03-open-and-prep.md)) — **built
  2026-07-04.** Each past-1:1 row is now a button that reopens the PG2 read-only detail; a primary "Prep
  your next 1:1 with <name>" button seeds a fresh intake with the person's name/role (intake reads
  `store.ctx`) and opens the form. **Money-path:** seeding + opening intake spends nothing; only running the
  full pipeline from there spends — flagged in QA. Typecheck clean, `npm test` 53/53.
- [x] **UI polish** (Carl asked mid-phase) — the person page got real hierarchy: "Since last time" is an
  elevated, colour-coded card (mint = agreed, gold = watch), a scannable stat line under the name, and the
  past 1:1s as a quiet dividered log. New scoped classes in `design.css`; 14px floor kept.
- [ ] **99 — QA sign-off** ([99-qa-signoff.md](005-person-detail/99-qa-signoff.md)) — **awaiting Carl's walk.**

Next: `go` → build Step 01 (the person page).

**Phase 004 — Team, auto-built — ✅ `done` (signed off + committed 2026-07-04).**
Carl walked the QA (`demo@sero.test`) — people grouped from `/runs/mine`, case/spacing duplicates merge,
single-meeting card reads "1 meeting · not yet rated", empty state for no runs, nav + page relabelled
"Past 1:1s". Baseline was green (`npm test` 53/53, typecheck clean).

PG4 steps:
- [x] **01 — Team page** ([01-team-auto-built.md](004-team-auto-built/01-team-auto-built.md)) — new shared
  helper `admin/src/ui/group-people.js` → `groupRunsByPerson(runs)` (normalized-name key so "Priya"/"priya"
  merge; rolls up count / last-met / avg stars + rated-count; sorted most-recent-met first; pure, reused by
  PG5). `team.ts` rewritten to fetch `listMyRuns()`, group, and render `.card-flat` cards with own
  loading / empty / error states, names escaped.
- [x] **02 — Relabel Runs → "Past 1:1s"** ([02-relabel-runs.md](004-team-auto-built/02-relabel-runs.md)) —
  nav + page now read "Past 1:1s" (`app-nav.js`, `runs.ts`); admin screens untouched. (Row → person
  click-through is **PG5**, intentionally not here.)
- [x] **99 — QA sign-off** ([99-qa-signoff.md](004-team-auto-built/99-qa-signoff.md)) — all 5 walk
  scenarios green; Carl green-lit 2026-07-04.

**Phase 003 — Rate a 1:1 — ✅ `done` (signed off 2026-07-03, committed `6ae77667`).**

All four build steps done, verified live, and committed + merged to `main` on Carl's "commit and move on".
(The parallel session's duplicate step files were consolidated into the coherent set below.)

PG3 steps:
- [x] **01 — Backend rating** ([01-backend-rating.md](003-rate-a-1-1/01-backend-rating.md)) — route
  `POST /api/v1/runs/mine/:id/rating`, `rateMine` (stars 1–5 number → 400, org+user fence → 404, note
  trim/cap, **atomic** `rating.json`), `rating` surfaced on list + detail payloads, 5 tests, gitignore.
- [x] **02 — Rate on the detail** ([02-rate-on-detail.md](003-rate-a-1-1/02-rate-on-detail.md)) — shared
  keyboard-operable star widget (`admin/src/ui/star-rating.js`) on `run-detail`; low score (≤2) reveals a
  "What missed?" note; persists (destination verified live).
- [x] **03 — Rate in-flow** ([03-in-flow-rating.md](003-rate-a-1-1/03-in-flow-rating.md)) — the same
  widget at the end of a 1:1 (`BRIEFING`) with a plain **Skip**; hidden for the scripted test lane; no nag.
- [x] **04 — List badge** ([04-list-badge.md](003-rate-a-1-1/04-list-badge.md)) — a compact ★N badge on
  rated Runs rows; unrated rows stay clean.
- [~] **99 — QA sign-off** ([99-qa-signoff.md](003-rate-a-1-1/99-qa-signoff.md)) — Carl tried it live
  (`demo@sero.test`) and said commit + move on; formal walk of every scenario still open if he wants it.

**Phase 002 ✅ signed off (Carl walked it live, 2026-07-01) + committed.**

Phase 002 (done) steps:
- [x] **01 — API client** — `getMyRun(id)` → `GET /api/v1/runs/mine/:id` in `shared/api.js`.
- [x] **02 — Detail stage** — new `admin/src/stages/run-detail.ts` at `/runs/:id` (member stage
  `RUN_DETAIL` + `myRunId`); state/router/main plumbing (parse, boot, popstate); read-only briefing
  render (What stood out / understood / honest read / what to do next / reminders), loading / error /
  not-found states, every value escaped.
- [x] **03 — Wire rows** — Runs rows are now keyboard-operable `<button>`s that open the detail;
  `.runs-list__row` style added.
- [x] **99 — QA sign-off** — Carl walked it (member login, seeded runs): list → click Priya → read-only
  briefing opened; foreign id → 404. ✅ green-lit.

Verified (free): `npm test` 53/53 · `npm run typecheck` clean. Live (real app, stubbed run):
`/runs/r1` routes to the detail, subtitle + all five briefing sections render, `<it>` escaped, no console
errors; a bad/foreign id → the "couldn't open" card (404 fence). Phase 001 (done) below.

**Also in the tree (bundled with PG2, will commit together): `cloneRun` — a dev-only QA-helper.**
Admin-guarded (`requireAdmin`) "prefill a run" tool: `GET /api/v1/runs/clonable` + `POST
/api/v1/runs/clone` (origin-checked) clone a finished run into a fresh one owned by the caller, so a
manager has *owned* test runs to walk the 001/002 QA (the userId-attribution cutover makes older runs
invisible). Not a pre-go-live phase feature — accepted 2026-07-01 (Carl, option A) as test-data scaffolding.
Carve-out: it's admin-only and dev-only; keep it out of the member surface. (Momentary typecheck gap — the
`RunsRepo` mock lacked `cloneRun` — was closed; tree is green again.)

## Phase board

| # | Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 001 | Manager Runs list | ✅ done (signed off + committed) |
| 002 | Reopen a run | ✅ done (signed off + committed) |
| 003 | Rate a 1:1 | ✅ done (signed off + committed) |
| 004 | Team — auto-built people | ✅ done (signed off + committed) |
| 005 | Person detail | ✅ done (signed off + committed) |
| 006 | Superadmin gate (backend) | ✅ done (signed off + committed) |
| 007 | Admin: who's registered | planned (broken down; building next) |
| 008 | Admin: user → teams → runs | not-started |
| 009 | Roster + polish | not-started |

## Baseline (fill in before touching code in a phase)
- **2026-07-01 — Phase 001 baseline (free checks, no OpenAI):** `npm test` **53/53 passed**,
  `npm run typecheck` **clean**. (Up from the 52/52 last-known-good — suite has grown.) This is the
  green line Phase 001 work is measured against.

## Decisions
- **2026-07-01 — Track created.** Pre-go-live scaffolded as a sibling to prototype-to-production, 9 phases.
  Supersedes the deferred member-nav Phase 2 (real Runs) and 009's deferred "real Team content" — both are
  folded in here so the trackers don't multiply.
- **2026-07-01 — Team = auto-built from past 1:1s** (group by person). Explicit roster / merge is Phase 009.
- **2026-07-01 — Rating = 1–5 stars "How useful?" + optional note**, editable; stored as a `rating.json`
  sidecar in the run folder (no DB migration for the alpha). Carl sees all ratings.
- **2026-07-01 — Admin view = cross-company superadmin**, gated to Carl's account only, read-only. The one
  intentional wall-crossing (Phases 006–008); the per-company fence stays intact for everyone else.

## Decisions (from the CTO review, 2026-07-01)
- **Keep the `rating.json` sidecar — do NOT add DB columns/backfill for the alpha.** Senior panel overruled
  the "add `user_id`/`rating`/`person_key` columns" recommendation: the `runs` DB table is a stub off the
  run write-path, the superadmin view loops the real `organizations`/`users` tables + reuses the per-org run
  walk, and reading a few dozen rating files is trivial at alpha scale. The DB-column move is the **parked
  scale-up trigger** below, not now. (Carve-out kept: the sidecar write must be **atomic** — temp + rename.)
- **Continuity "Since last time" (minimal) added to Phase 005.** The one make-or-break UX fix: surface the
  most recent run's `next_actions` + `watch_for` on the person page (data already in the payload — near
  free). This is a *minimal slice* of the deferred "remembering", NOT the full cross-session system.
  **Awaiting Carl's nod** — he can park even this slice.
- **In-flow rating (Phase 003):** a gentle one-tap rating at the **end of a 1:1** (+ Skip), not only on the
  reopened detail — else adoption craters and Carl's honest signal dries up. No "X unrated" nag ever.
- **Team is primary; "Runs" → "Past 1:1s" (Phase 004):** person-centric is the return-visit mental model;
  the flat list is the secondary "all activity" view.
- **Each phase owns its loading/empty/error states** (OVERVIEW standing expectations); Phase 009 shrinks to
  merge + roll-ups. Manual roster, search/filter, and trend sparkline are **parked** (scope-creep for a 2–3
  manager alpha).
- **Superadmin security must-haves (Phase 006):** email resolved server-side from the authenticated userId
  (never client input); structurally read-only module (GET-only, no write imports); one-line access audit;
  403 tests with `DEV_AUTOLOGIN` off; dev side-door can never match the allowlist.

## Before we widen past 2–3 friendly managers (inherited conditions — do not lose)
- **Human-expert security review** (deferred in 009) **must explicitly cover the new superadmin
  wall-crossing** — the waiver was written for the existing fence, which had no cross-tenant key.
- **Close the anonymous session-start route** (`POST /api/v1/sessions`) — the 009 "before widening" gate.
- **Update the privacy note** to disclose that ratings (incl. the free-text note) are stored, and that an
  internal Sero admin can view a company's users/teams/runs across companies. Tell the alpha managers
  before their staff data is viewable.
- **Classify the rating note as a private manager field** (like `brutal_truth_manager`): never in any
  employee-facing/shared surface, never logged; add `**/rating.json` to `.gitignore` belt-and-braces.

## Parked (don't expand the current step — capture here)
- Manual people roster ("add a person ahead of time"), search/filter on Team/Runs, trend sparkline/charts —
  all post-alpha (build only if a real manager asks).
- Promote person-grouping to a server `GET /api/v1/team` endpoint if client-side grouping outgrows the payload.
- Move ratings from a sidecar file to a DB column (with a `runs.user_id` column + backfill) once the alpha
  grows past a handful of managers and cross-org aggregates need SQL.

## Activity log
- **2026-07-01** — Track scaffolded: README, OVERVIEW, PROGRESS, and the nine `00-phase-overview.md`
  files created. Phase 001 not yet broken down.
- **2026-07-01** — Baseline recorded (`npm test` 53/53, typecheck clean). **Phase 001 broken down**
  into 2 build steps + QA (`01-api-client.md`, `02-render-runs-list.md`, `99-qa-signoff.md`); status
  → `planned`. Confirmed the endpoint + fence already exist (`runs.mine` → `myFinished` →
  `listFinishedRunsForMember`), so 001 is pure front-end wiring — no backend change. **Flagged:** the
  nav relabel "Runs → Past 1:1s" is left to Phase 004 (per the CTO decision), not done in 001, to
  avoid the overview's Note and the CTO decision fighting. No code touched yet. Next: `what next?` → do
  Step 01.
- **2026-07-01** — **Step 01 done.** Added `listMyRuns()` (→ `GET /api/v1/runs/mine`) beside the
  other run calls in `shared/api.js`. Free checks green: `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm test` 53/53.
  Phase status → `in-progress`. Next: Step 02 (render the list in `runs.ts`).
- **2026-07-01** — CTO-level review run (standard team of 4 → senior panel of 2). Applied the agreed
  minimal edit set to OVERVIEW + phases 001–007 & 009 (security, in-flow rating, continuity, Team-primary,
  per-phase states, telemetry). Plan judged right-sized (not verbose); gaps were *aspects*, now closed.
  Next: `what next?` → break down Phase 001.
- **2026-07-01** — **Reconciled state.** Found the tree had advanced past this session: PG1 done +
  committed (`3cc5ef9d`), PG2 (reopen a run) built + `awaiting-qa`, plus an off-plan admin-only
  `cloneRun` QA-helper that had briefly broken typecheck (mock repo missing `cloneRun`) — since closed;
  tree green (`npm test` 53/53, typecheck clean). Carl chose to keep `cloneRun` (option A); logged it.
- **2026-07-01** — **Phase 002 signed off + committed.** Set up a live walk: seeded 3 member-owned
  finished runs (Priya / Marco / Ade, in `logs/` which is gitignored) for `member@seroteams.com`, ran
  API 3001 + Vite 3000, confirmed the chain (login → list newest-first → click → read-only briefing;
  foreign id → 404). Carl walked it and green-lit. Committed PG2 + `cloneRun`. Next: break down Phase 003.
- **2026-07-02** — **Phase 003 broken down** → 3 front-end steps (`01-rate-on-detail`, `02-rate-in-flow`,
  `03-list-badge`) + existing QA sheet; status → `planned`. On reading the code, found the **PG3 backend
  already built + green** (route/service/repo/tests/payload/gitignore all present; `npm test` 53/53,
  typecheck clean) — another parallel batch ran ahead, so the steps consume it rather than rebuild it.
  No new code written this turn. Next: `go` → Step 01 (client call + accessible star widget on run-detail).
- **2026-07-03** — **Phase 003 signed off + committed (`6ae77667`).** Carl tried it live (`demo@sero.test`)
  and said commit + move on; PG3 (rate a 1:1, end-to-end) landed on `main`.
- **2026-07-04** — **Phase 004 signed off + committed.** Built on a short-lived `fable-playground` branch
  (identical to `main`, no unique commits); Carl asked to drop that branch, so PG4's working-tree changes
  moved to `main` and the branch was deleted. Baseline free checks green (`npm test` 53/53, typecheck
  clean). Carl walked the PG4 QA (Team page groups people from `/runs/mine`, case/spacing merge, honest
  single-meeting + empty states, nav relabelled "Past 1:1s") and green-lit. Committed PG4; ticked STATUS +
  SERO_BOARD + build badges (PG3 3 steps + PG4 3 steps → done; corrected PG4 step-2 wording that had
  mis-bundled the PG5 person-link into PG4) + refreshed the how-it-works changelog. Next: `go` → break down
  Phase 005 (Person detail).
- **2026-07-04** — **Phase 005 built + signed off + committed.** Broke PG5 into 3 steps + QA, built them in
  sequence with Carl checking between: Step 01 person page (`4bad9961`, new `PERSON_DETAIL` stage at
  `/team/:person`, shared `personKeyOf` so the page filters on the same key the grouping uses), Step 02
  "Since last time" (`810f9b14`, fetches the latest run's detail — no OpenAI), a mid-phase UI polish Carl
  asked for (`81fa5adf`, elevated colour-coded recap + scannable header + quiet log), Step 03 open-a-run +
  prep-next (`99005e9e`, rows → PG2 detail, "Prep next 1:1" seeds intake — free until a full pipeline runs).
  Carl walked it ("looks good commit") → PG5 ✅. Ticked STATUS + SERO_BOARD + build badges (PG5 3 steps →
  done) + how-it-works changelog. Free checks green throughout (53/53, typecheck clean); no paid runs.
  Next: `go` → break down Phase 006 (superadmin gate).
- **2026-07-04** — **Phase 006 built + signed off + committed.** Broke PG6 into 3 test-first steps + QA,
  grounded against real symbols (found `RequestIdentity.email` is already server-resolved, so the guard was a
  thin add). Built test-first: Step 01 guard (`23b59a37`, `requireSuperadmin` + `requireSuperadminRoute`, 8
  tests incl. dev-side-door → 403), Step 02 cross-company read (`370cdc64`, read-only `superadmin`
  service/repo + guarded GET `/api/v1/admin/registered`, no `password_hash`), Step 03 audit line
  (`cbfe99c6`, one JSONL record per access, refused not audited, hermetic). Carl approved the security shape
  + tests ("approved") → PG6 ✅. Ticked STATUS + SERO_BOARD + build badges (PG6 2 chips → done) + changelog.
  56/56, typecheck clean; no paid runs. **Carry-forward before widening the alpha stays open by design.**
  Next: `go` → break down Phase 007 (who's registered — the first superadmin screen).
