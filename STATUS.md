# STATUS — where we are right now

**This is the live tracker for the phase plan we're actively working through.**
One place. Always current. I update it the moment a phase starts or gets your green light — you never have to ask.
For the big-picture feature board, see [SERO_BOARD.md](SERO_BOARD.md). For full detail, open the plan linked below.
Not sure which file is which? [docs/TRACKERS.md](docs/TRACKERS.md) maps where everything lives.

## ▶ Your move

**Admin access guard (Option A) — DONE and closed ✅. Nothing is actively in flight — pick what's next.**

The internal admin tooling is now separated from the customer flow *without* the big app split: login-gated
(Phase 1) and admin-role-gated (Phase 2). A plain member is refused the tooling (403) and can't see it in the
console; owners are unaffected. Verified over HTTP (anon 401 · member 403 · owner 200 · prep flow 200).

- **Phase 1 ✅ — require login on the internal tooling.** (committed `370033b5`)
- **Phase 2 ✅ — the admin-role wall + hide the UI.** (green-lit + committed 2026-07-01)
- Plus a dev-only **Admin/Standard login quick-swap** to make testing the wall easy (`53dbd0ae`).

Plan archived at [docs/todo/done/admin-access-guard/](docs/todo/done/admin-access-guard/PLAN.md). Parked for
later: the fuller splits — **Option B** (`/api/admin/*` route prefix) and **Option C** (a separate customer
`frontend/` app) — plus a roles-management UI (invite teammates, assign owner/admin/member).

**👉 Pick the next thing** — a parked plan below, or an item from [SERO_BOARD.md](SERO_BOARD.md).

- Last updated: 2026-07-01
- Phase 2 close-out: `npm test` 52/52 · typecheck clean · `npm run build` clean.

### Just finished: Auth hardening ✅ (closed)
Both post-007 holes shut, tested, committed. Phase 1 (live sessions fenced by company, `12fc3071`) · Phase 2
(runs endpoints require login, session *start* stays open by your call). Archived at
[docs/todo/done/auth-hardening/](docs/todo/done/auth-hardening/PLAN.md). Prior: Phase 007 login screen ✅
([docs/todo/done/login-screen/](docs/todo/done/login-screen/PLAN.md)).

## Parked / backlog plans (NOT in-flight)

Nothing below is actively being worked. They're scaffolded ideas in `docs/todo/`,
waiting for a scope pick or a turn. Listed here so the folder count never *looks*
like 8 things are half-done at once — they aren't.

| Plan | State |
|---|---|
| [planner-grounding](docs/todo/planner-grounding/PLAN.md) | parked — awaiting scope pick (A/B/C/all) |
| [briefing-readability-p0](docs/todo/briefing-readability-p0/PLAN.md) | parked |
| [briefing-grounding-fixes](docs/todo/briefing-grounding-fixes/PLAN.md) | awaiting |
| [see-before-sent](docs/todo/see-before-sent/PLAN.md) | awaiting |
| [sent-preview](docs/todo/sent-preview/PLAN.md) | awaiting |
| [stage-data-tabs](docs/todo/stage-data-tabs/PLAN.md) | awaiting |
| [repo-tidy](docs/todo/repo-tidy/PLAN.md) | awaiting |
| [todo-board-rebuild](docs/todo/todo-board-rebuild/PLAN.md) | awaiting |

When one becomes live, move it up into "Your move" above and start its phases.

## Just-finished plan: Phase 006 — The front door (Auth) ✅

📄 [docs/todo/done/auth-front-door/PLAN.md](docs/todo/done/auth-front-door/PLAN.md)
**Goal:** real register/login with safe passwords, guarded pages, signup that creates the company (data
fenced per-company) — plus a dev-only one-click login that's sealed shut for real customers. **All delivered.**

| # | Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Accounts tables ready | ✅ committed `2e43a42e` |
| 2 | Register & login with safe passwords | ✅ committed `d1a6b8c6` |
| 3 | Keep people in, guard the doors (+ dev side-door) | ✅ committed `c303f136` |
| 4 | Signup creates the company | ✅ committed |

**Before that:** Postgres Foundation → [docs/todo/done/postgres-foundation/PLAN.md](docs/todo/done/postgres-foundation/PLAN.md) (all 4 phases ✅, committed `b079b88b`).

## How to read the boxes
`⬜ not started` · `🔨 in progress` · `✅ done (tested + green-lit)`
A pass isn't ✅ until its QA is walked and green-lit — I never self-certify.
